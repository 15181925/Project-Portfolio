Project Name: Enhancing Accessibility and Emergency Features for Apple Devices

Country: United States of America

Job Role: Project Manager

Organization: Northeastern University 

Project Period: N/A (Product Advice to Apple)

Project Description:

During my daily commutes on public transportation in the U.S., I observed several blind individuals using Apple devices. One incident stood outâ€”a blind woman attempting to cancel an ad in a news app but struggling because the interface was not accessible. This experience sparked the idea for a project to improve accessibility for blind users. The proposal included an "Ad-Free Accessibility Mode," which would disable intrusive ads when accessibility features like VoiceOver are active, allowing seamless access to essential apps. Additionally, I envisioned voice-activated shortcuts (e.g., "Hey Siri, give me the news") for direct navigation without requiring complex interactions. These ideas aimed to remove barriers and make devices truly user-friendly for the blind community, reflecting Apple's commitment to inclusivity and innovation. This project reinforced the importance of small, thoughtful changes that can significantly impact underrepresented communities.

The second feature focused on emergency calls, drawing from my experience working on a dementia patient watch in a previous project. If Apple could integrate similar functionality into the Apple Watch, it would monitor the user's heartbeat and, if the count falls below a certain threshold, display an automatic notification pop-up on the watch. If the person cannot dismiss the notification, the watch would directly transfer a call to 911. This feature would allow emergency authorities to respond promptly, potentially saving lives in critical situations. These ideas are aimed at improving inclusivity, usability, and safety for all users.
