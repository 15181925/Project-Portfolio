## Project: Energy Systems Design in the US Southwest
- **Country**: United States of America
- **Job Role**: Project Manager
- **Organization**: Northeastern University
- **Project Period**: April 2024 – June 2024
- **Description**: Led the "Energy Systems Design in the US Southwest" project, collaborating with GenH to analyze interconnection processes, timelines, and costs for deploying modular hydropower systems in Southern California and Arizona. Managed a team to identify key utility providers, assess regulatory requirements, and evaluate technical and financial feasibility for integrating renewable energy systems into utility grids. Delivered a comprehensive report outlining step-by-step interconnection processes, key milestones, and financial planning insights, supporting GenH's mission to electrify non-powered dams and advance sustainable energy adoption.

## Project: Enhancing Accessibility and Emergency Features for Apple Devices
- **Country**: United States of America
- **Job Role**: Project Manager
- **Organization**: Northeastern University
- **Description**: During my daily commutes on public transportation in the U.S., I observed several blind individuals using Apple devices. One incident stood out—a blind woman attempting to cancel an ad in a news app but struggling because the interface was not accessible. This experience sparked the idea for a project to improve accessibility for blind users. The proposal included an "Ad-Free Accessibility Mode," which would disable intrusive ads when accessibility features like VoiceOver are active, allowing seamless access to essential apps. Additionally, I envisioned voice-activated shortcuts (e.g., "Hey Siri, give me the news") for direct navigation without requiring complex interactions. These ideas aimed to remove barriers and make devices truly user-friendly for the blind community, reflecting Apple's commitment to inclusivity and innovation. This project reinforced the importance of small, thoughtful changes that can significantly impact underrepresented communities. The second feature focused on emergency calls, drawing from my experience working on a dementia patient watch in a previous project. If Apple could integrate similar functionality into the Apple Watch, it would monitor the user's heartbeat and, if the count falls below a certain threshold, display an automatic notification pop-up on the watch. If the person cannot dismiss the notification, the watch would directly transfer a call to 911. This feature would allow emergency authorities to respond promptly, potentially saving lives in critical situations. These ideas are aimed at improving inclusivity, usability, and safety for all users.

## Project: Customized Access Floor System for Nokia Server Rooms
- **Country**: India
- **Job Role**: Operations Project Manager
- **Organization**: Tankaria Industries Pvt. Ltd
- **Project Period**: December 2021 – February 2022
- **Description**: While working with Nokia, I noticed that they were sourcing 40mm access floor panels for their server rooms from outside India due to specific design requirements, which increased project costs and lead times. This inspired me to explore an innovative solution to meet their needs locally. I developed a customized panel by combining multiple layers of plywood (17mm, 11mm, and 11mm) and finishing it with 1mm sunmica, while also integrating a conductivity system to maintain optimal performance. This design not only adhered to their specifications but also reduced production complexity and eliminated unnecessary steps in the process. Although the initial project timeline was estimated at five months, I re-engineered the workflow and completed the project in just three months. The success of this project highlighted the value of innovative, efficient solutions in delivering cost-effective results and meeting client expectations.

## Project: Thermal Insulated Container Design for the Indian Army
- **Country**: India
- **Job Role**: Operations Project Manager
- **Organization**: Tankaria Industries Pvt. Ltd
- **Project Period**: June 2020 – August 2020
- **Description**: During my tenure at Tankaria Industries Pvt. Ltd., I worked on a critical project to design a specialized container for the Indian Army. The goal was to create a solution that could withstand extreme cold weather conditions while ensuring functionality and ease of use. I led the development of a prototype container featuring thermal insulation and access floors to provide durability and temperature regulation. This container was tailored for deployment in challenging terrains, addressing the Army's operational needs. The design was in its early stages, with the project awaiting approval from the Indian Army for full-scale production. This project underscored the importance of innovative engineering solutions in addressing unique client requirements and contributing to national defense infrastructure.

## Project: Bridge Monitoring System at King Fahad Causeway
- **Country**: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain
- **Job Role**: Technical Project Manager
- **Organization**: Capital Projects Co. WLL
- **Project Period**: February 2017 – March 2018
- **Description**: This project involved deploying the Trimble Bridge Monitoring System on the King Fahad Causeway, a 25-kilometer-long bridge connecting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The system was designed to enhance structural safety and optimize maintenance by providing real-time data on key parameters such as load, vibrations, and environmental conditions. As the project manager, I oversaw the end-to-end implementation, from stakeholder coordination to the successful installation and calibration of Trimble's advanced sensors and monitoring tools. The system enabled predictive maintenance and minimized potential downtime, ensuring the causeway's safety and efficiency. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of Trimble technology in maintaining and managing critical infrastructure.

## Project: Thermal Corrugated Coffee Boxes for Starbucks
- **Country**: United States of America
- **Job Role**: Business Analyst
- **Organization**: Northeastern University
- **Project Period**: September 2024 – December 2024
- **Description**: In Boston's cold weather, we noticed coffee often becomes cold quickly during deliveries and group orders. To address this, our team proposed thermally insulated corrugated coffee boxes to Starbucks, designed to retain heat for extended periods. The solution combined effective thermal capacity with eco-friendly materials, aligning with Starbucks' sustainability goals. The product was adopted and launched, enhancing customer satisfaction during colder months.

## Project: Access Floor System with Ceramic Tiles for SRF
- **Country**: India
- **Job Role**: Operations Project Manager
- **Organization**: Tankaria Industries Pvt. Ltd
- **Project Period**: November 2022 – April 2023
- **Description**: This project focused on designing and delivering a customized access floor system for SRF, integrating ceramic tiles for enhanced durability and aesthetics. SRF had previously sourced ceramic tiles from China, which led to increased costs and extended timelines. To address this, I proposed and implemented a streamlined production process where ceramic tiles were directly fixed to access floor panels during manufacturing. This innovation eliminated additional labor-intensive steps, reduced manufacturing costs by $4.5 per panel, and accelerated the project timeline by 20%. The successful execution of this project not only met SRF's quality and design requirements but also showcased the benefits of localized, efficient manufacturing solutions.

## Project: Smart Watch and Assistive Features Design for Dementia Patients and Caregivers
