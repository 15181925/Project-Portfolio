Country: United States of America

In Boston's cold weather, we noticed coffee often becomes cold quickly during deliveries and group orders. To address this, our team proposed thermally insulated corrugated coffee boxes to Starbucks, designed to retain heat for extended periods. The solution combined effective thermal capacity with eco-friendly materials, aligning with Starbucks' sustainability goals.
