Project Description:
During my tenure at Tankaria Industries Pvt. Ltd., I worked on a critical project to design a specialized container for the Indian Army. The goal was to create a solution that could withstand extreme cold weather conditions while ensuring functionality and ease of use. I led the development of a prototype container featuring thermal insulation and access floors to provide durability and temperature regulation.
This container was tailored for deployment in challenging terrains, addressing the Army's operational needs. The design was in its early stages, with the project awaiting approval from the Indian Army for full-scale production. This project underscored the importance of innovative engineering solutions in addressing unique client requirements and contributing to national defense infrastructure.
