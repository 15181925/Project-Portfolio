Project Name: Access Floor System with Ceramic Tiles for SRF

Country: India

Job Role: Operations Project Manager

Organization: Tankaria Industries Pvt. Ltd

Project Period: November 2022 â€“ April 2023

Project Description:
This project focused on designing and delivering a customized access floor system for SRF, integrating ceramic tiles for enhanced durability and aesthetics. SRF had previously sourced ceramic tiles from China, which led to increased costs and extended timelines. To address this, I proposed and implemented a streamlined production process where ceramic tiles were directly fixed to access floor panels during manufacturing.

This innovation eliminated additional labor-intensive steps, reduced manufacturing costs by $4.5 per panel, and accelerated the project timeline by 20%. The successful execution of this project not only met SRF's quality and design requirements but also showcased the benefits of localized, efficient manufacturing solutions.
