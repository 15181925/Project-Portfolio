Project Name: Customized Access Floor System for Nokia Server Rooms

Country: India

Job Role: Operations Project Manager

Organization: Tankaria Industries Pvt. Ltd

Project Period: December 2021 â€“ February 2022

Project Description:
While working with Nokia, I noticed that they were sourcing 40mm access floor panels for their server rooms from outside India due to specific design requirements, which increased project costs and lead times. This inspired me to explore an innovative solution to meet their needs locally. I developed a customized panel by combining multiple layers of plywood (17mm, 11mm, and 11mm) and finishing it with 1mm sunmica, while also integrating a conductivity system to maintain optimal performance.
This design not only adhered to their specifications but also reduced production complexity and eliminated unnecessary steps in the process. Although the initial project timeline was estimated at five months, I re-engineered the workflow and completed the project in just three months. The success of this project highlighted the value of innovative, efficient solutions in delivering cost-effective results and meeting client expectations.
