Project Period: February 2017 â€“ March 2018

Project Description:
This project involved deploying the Trimble Bridge Monitoring System on the King Fahad Causeway, a 25-kilometer-long bridge connecting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The system was designed to enhance structural safety and optimize maintenance by providing real-time data on key parameters such as load, vibrations, and environmental conditions.

As the project manager, I oversaw the end-to-end implementation, from stakeholder coordination to the successful installation and calibration of Trimble's advanced sensors and monitoring tools. The system enabled predictive maintenance and minimized potential downtime, ensuring the causeway's safety and efficiency. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of Trimble technology in maintaining and managing critical infrastructure.
