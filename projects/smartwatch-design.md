As part of a product development class, our team designed a smart watch and associated assistive features tailored for dementia patients and their caregivers. The watch focused on improving safety, usability, and accessibility, incorporating features such as location tracking, medication reminders, and emergency call functionality. For added user convenience, we designed an intuitive caregiver dashboard (SDS) to allow real-time monitoring and management of patient needs.
