Project Name: Human Power Conversion into Electricity Using a Swing

Country: India

Job Role: Project Designer

Organization: Academic Project

Project Period: January 2016 â€“ June 2016

Project Description:
This project focused on converting human kinetic energy into electricity using a swing. The objective was to develop a sustainable energy generation model by harnessing the mechanical motion of a swing and converting it into electrical energy for practical applications. To achieve this, we designed and built a prototype using a combination of lathe machines, drill machines, and welding machines. The system incorporated a gear mechanism to amplify the swing's motion, which powered a dynamo to generate electricity. The output was stored in a small battery, demonstrating the viability of human-powered energy solutions. This project provided hands-on experience with mechanical tools and showcased the potential for innovative, sustainable energy systems in daily life.
